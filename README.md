# bossMachine

This WIP project is to create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I will create routes to manage ‘minions’, brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to their busy schedules.

This project is from Codecademy's backend development path.

# bossMachine

This project is to create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I will create routes to manage ‘minions’, brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to their busy schedules.

This project is from Codecademy's backend development path.

Steps for running:
1. Begin by cloning this repository to your local folder using the command "Git clone [project link]".
2. Next, open your code editor and navigate to the project directory.
3. In your terminal, execute the command "npm install" to download all the necessary dependencies.
4. To start the application, run either "npm run start" or "nodemon server.js" in your terminal.
5. Open "index.html" in your web browser, preferably Google Chrome, to access the site.
6. Explore the website's features, and feel free to immerse yourself in the experience. Manage your virtual empire, cancel all your meetings, and brainstorm your next big money-making schemes!
7. If you'd like to run tests, simply enter "npm run test" in your terminal.
   
Enjoy the journey!
Project Status: 
Satisfactorily completed with all tests passing. 

I will come back to this if I need to practice modifying the front end, or if I want to practice tightening some of the logic. 

This project helped me flex my RESTful API muscles. I also got to practice building subroutes.
